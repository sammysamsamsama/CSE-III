I thought the instructions were very clear. 
There were probably one or two instructions I can see people struggling with because they don't explain themselves.
For example: Finally, if zero is true, then set grid[r][c] back to zero.
It doesn't explicitly state that this is because if the position previously contained zero, it would refill zero so
	it can continue checking for solutions. Since it is recursive, refilling with zeros does not interfere with
	the solution tostring. This makes sense to me, but maybe not to others.
